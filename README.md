# WordPress To Netlify Build Plugin 🏗️

This is a small WordPress plugin that triggers builds on a site deployed on Netlify. This is
useful for Static Site Generators such as Gatsby, Hugo or Jekyll that are using
the WordPress REST API as a data source, but require build commands or manual rebuilds on Netlify
to show the newly updated content.
